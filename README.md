# Wizard101-Damage-Calculator

Heya this is a Coursework for my University which I made and thought that people would have a use of it(Also it's my first project as a whole)

The program allows the user to easily add any kind of Damage Modificators(Blades and Shields) so that they can quickly calculate what the damage output can be

The Program itself was required to include: 
- All 4 parts of OOP(Abstraction, Encpsulation, Polymorphism and Inheritance)
- LINQ
- Serialization 
- And Windows Forms

The Program includes:
- All the forementioned things
- A "UI" that allows the user to quickly add Damage Modificators in the queue
- The Calculation and Pierce mechanics of the game
- An option to Create/Delete/Load a Character(Boss or Wizard)
- A quick way to change stats on the go if you are using a different one-time setup
- Some general QoL aspects(Reset Button, Remove Last Input...etc)
- A way of checking the whole Queue of Blades and Shields and a way to delete a selected item or all of an itme with a certain type
- A way of selecting each type of spell each with its own separate values and Enchantments(if it needs one)
- 5 Base Characters that can be selected and their stats can be automatically loaded and can't be removed:

  My Personal Wizard - Stephen DragonGiver
  
  Malistaire
  
  Krokopatra
  
  Jade Oni
  
  Queen Calypso
  
All in all as my first ever project I think it turned out great as I used only the skills I have been taught in University 1st year.

I would be glad to update it if it ever gains some sort of attention :)

PS: The names of the first 2 folders are named with Bulgarian names as I didn't think about publishing it on github :(
